# HospitalSystem

Write a program that computes a patient’s bill for a hospital stay. The different components of the program are:
* The PatientAccount class will keep a total of the patient’s charges. It will also keep track of the number of days spent in the hospital. The group must decide on which hospital to use and gather necessary data such as getting the hospital’s daily rate – for each type of room.
* The Surgery class will have stored within it the charges for at least five types of surgery. It can update the charges variable of the PatientAccount class.
* The Pharmacy class will have stored within it the price of at least five types of medication. It can be update the charges variable of the PatientAccount class.
* The main program.
The main program should have a main menu that allows the user to enter type of surgery, enter one or more types of medication, and check the patient out of the hospital. When the patient checks out, the total charges should be displayed.
Files needed for the project:
* Main
* PatientAccount class declaration
* PatientAccount function definitions
* Surgery class declaration
* Surgery function definitions
* Pharmacy class declaration
* Pharmacy function definitions
